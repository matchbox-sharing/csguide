# How to learn Software Engineering ?

I don't think there is just one or two courses can cover this topic, since it is so widely applied everywhere and anytime in software production. But for sure, there are some courses you could take.

* [MIT: Performance Engineering of Software Systems](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-172-performance-engineering-of-software-systems-fall-2010/)
* [MIT: Engineering Innovation and Design](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/engineering-systems-division/esd-051j-engineering-innovation-and-design-fall-2012/)

And there are tools we could list here, however, it may change with time.

* Planning
* Design
* Development
* Test
* CI/CD
* Performance Analysis
