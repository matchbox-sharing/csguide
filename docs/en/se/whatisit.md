# What is Software Engineer ?

Software engineering is the application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method.

Conceptually, there is no big difference from other engineering. It tries to find better and better solution to the engineering problems, such as

* How to decrease the time of software delivery ?
* How to gurantee better software performance ?
* How to motivate engineers to work efficientlly ?
* How to do A/B test ?
* How to create parallel CI (Continues Integration) ?
* How to scale a team ?
* How to create prototype for market test within shorter time ?

And questions can be more and more, everything related to lower cost, better performance, higher profit is considered as engineering problem.
